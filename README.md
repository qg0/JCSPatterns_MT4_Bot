# JCSPatterns_MT4_Bot
Experimental and simple robot for Metatrader 4

This is a Metatrader 4 experimental bot that I coded while freestyling around detection of Bullish Engulfing Patterns (in french : Avalements Haussiers).

This robot only detect bulling engulfing patterns.

It trades without Stop Loss so use it at your own risk if you test it on a real account.

I suggest that you do a lot of backtests before trying it on a real account. I also suggest that you use small lots.

You will have to change the Take Profit levels in the OrderSend() functions to set it properly for a specific instrument.

The default Take Profit levels are for GBPJPY in H1 timeframe.
